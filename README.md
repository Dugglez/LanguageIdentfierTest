# LanguageIdentfierTest
A little game I made which accesses the Google Translate API to translate some random sentences to different languages and challenges you to identify their language of origin.

You can run this by downloading the Python and Text files to your computer, then opening a command line at the location you have them saved, then running the following command.

python main.py

This brings you to the menu, where you choose your difficulty and your game length.
